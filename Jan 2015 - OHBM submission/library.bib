@article{Medkour2010,
abstract = {If, as is widely believed, schizophrenia is characterized by abnormalities of brain functional connectivity, then it seems reasonable to expect that different subtypes of schizophrenia could be discriminated in the same way. However, evidence for differences in functional connectivity between the subtypes of schizophrenia is largely lacking and, where it exists, it could be accounted for by clinical differences between the patients (e.g. medication) or by the limitations of the measures used. In this study, we measured EEG functional connectivity in unmedicated male patients diagnosed with either positive or negative syndrome schizophrenia and compared them with age and sex matched healthy controls. Using new methodology (Medkour et al., 2009) based on partial coherence, brain connectivity plots were constructed for positive and negative syndrome patients and controls. Reliable differences in the pattern of functional connectivity were found with both syndromes showing not only an absence of some of the connections that were seen in controls but also the presence of connections that the controls did not show. Comparing connectivity graphs using the Hamming distance, the negative-syndrome patients were found to be more distant from the controls than were the positive syndrome patients. Bootstrap distributions of these distances were created which showed a significant difference in the mean distances that was consistent with the observation that negative-syndrome diagnosis is associated with a more severe form of schizophrenia. We conclude that schizophrenia is characterized by widespread changes in functional connectivity with negative syndrome patients showing a more extreme pattern of abnormality than positive syndrome patients.},

@article{Arsigny2006,
abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DT-MRI or DTI) is an emerging imaging modality whose importance has been growing considerably. However, the processing of this type of data (i.e., symmetric positive-definite matrices), called "tensors" here, has proved difficult in recent years. Usual Euclidean operations on matrices suffer from many defects on tensors, which have led to the use of many ad hoc methods. Recently, affine-invariant Riemannian metrics have been proposed as a rigorous and general framework in which these defects are corrected. These metrics have excellent theoretical properties and provide powerful processing tools, but also lead in practice to complex and slow algorithms. To remedy this limitation, a new family of Riemannian metrics called Log-Euclidean is proposed in this article. They also have excellent theoretical properties and yield similar results in practice, but with much simpler and faster computations. This new approach is based on a novel vector space structure for tensors. In this framework, Riemannian computations can be converted into Euclidean ones once tensors have been transformed into their matrix logarithms. Theoretical aspects are presented and the Euclidean, affine-invariant, and Log-Euclidean frameworks are compared experimentally. The comparison is carried out on interpolation and regularization tasks on synthetic and clinical 3D DTI data.},

abstract = {Spectral and coherence methodologies are ubiquitous for the analysis of multiple time series. Partial coherence analysis may be used to try to determine graphical models for brain functional connectivity. The outcome of such an analysis may be considerably influenced by factors such as the degree of spectral smoothing, line and interference removal, matrix inversion stabilization and the suppression of effects caused by side-lobe leakage, the combination of results from different epochs and people, and multiple hypothesis testing. This paper examines each of these steps in turn and provides a possible path which produces relatively 'clean' connectivity plots. In particular we show how spectral matrix diagonal up-weighting can simultaneously stabilize spectral matrix inversion and reduce effects caused by side-lobe leakage, and use the stepdown multiple hypothesis test procedure to help formulate an interaction strength.},

This frequency domain measure for Granger-causality is designed such that it is normalized to [0,1]. This normalization induces several pitfalls for the interpretability of the ordinary partial directed coherence, which will be discussed in some detail in this paper. In order to avoid these pitfalls, we introduce renormalized partial directed coherence and calculate confidence intervals and significance levels. The performance of this novel concept is illustrated by application to model systems and to electroencephalography and electromyography data from a patient suffering from Parkinsonian tremor.},
